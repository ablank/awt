###Adam's Web Tools

This is a collection of tools & documentation on the web to get stuff done.
If you would like to recommend a tool or other resource not seen here, please contact me and I will add resources that meet the following criteria:
- Provide a useful and unique tool or superior documentation. 
- If it's not unique, how is it better than other solutions?


The tools/links are provided as a single HTML document to maximize portability. Any additional tools will utilize this same approach:

- single document, using tabs to switch between content regions.
- lightweight responsive style with no hard dependencies (graceful degradation)
- style css for modern browsers, but use xml markup syntax so older browsers still render.
- assets (images, scripts, etc.) delivered via CDN
