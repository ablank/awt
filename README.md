##Adam's Web Tools

This is a collection of tools & links on the web to get 'web stuff' done as easily as possible; Save it as either a bookmark or home page.

The tools and UI are enhanced with javascript - if you're that guy in a tinfoil hat who doesn't run javascript by default you should enable it for this page.

If you notice something awesome isn't listed here, please contact me and I will review it for inclusion.
